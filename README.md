This is a simple Godot 4 project that I used to learn the Godot game engine. It was my first project using Godot. The Suika Game is a simple Nintendo Switch game that was popular at the time of making this project.

This repos is a simple dump of the entire Godot project as it is on my computer.

If you are interested in seeing the process for yourself, I streamed myself making the game (3 streams, for a total of about 11 hours):
